Over the last year, i've gotten into repairing electronics for myself, friends, coworkers, and family rather than just enabling the throwing out of these devices or waiting for a few years for the next device contract to expire. For most devices that aren't the newest model, or the premier brand, to pay someone to fix the device, costs more than the actual value of the device. Most manufacturers, simply don't allow customers to buy spare parts to fix devices on their own. It is also amazing, simply how cheap manufacturers are able to sell products for. I assume they are so cheap because they factor in the accessories, insurance programs, and cost of repair to get the prices of initial purchase so low. I think this encourages people to just get on Amazon, Walmart, or their telecom provider, and buy a new device every time a device gets chipped or cracked. If these companies really cared about environmentalism, which they all say they do, and if consumers  cared as they claim they do, i think some coorindation needs to occur to change to improve the current status quo of buying and selling disposable devices.

In 2020 I've repaired:

For me:

2020 Moto E (failed screen replacement)
* * * While most of these devices are extremely cheap based on purchase price, they simply aren't designed to be repaired easily. To replace the screen of the device, this requires a complete device teardown (unscrewing 20 or screen and unconnecting all cables before removing battery which is not designed to be removed). Unfortunately, I rushed while attempting to remove the battery and didn't loosen the adhesive attaching battery to screenside of frame with a hair dryer enough, causing the battery to crack and catch fire.
* * * The value of this device purchased brand new is about 120$ on Amazon
* * * Screen costs 60 due to lack of availability on the second hand market (Motorola doesn't sell parts)
* * * Cost of certified repair (Motorola partners with shops to deliver parts) would be 150$ or mailing direct to to Motorola would be 130$

LG Phoneix 4 (Screen replacement)
* * * Brand new phone costs 40-60$ depending on time of year and vendor
* * * Screen replacement kit goes for $30 dollars here, so not much in savings in trying to fix, but still more experience fixing things can help you in the future with other devices.

For coworkers/friends:

Two Iphone 7 screen replacements
* * * Due to these phones being on company device plans, coworkers would be held liable if they were to turn their devices in to their company in an effort to repair.
* * * Each screen kit costed 24$ on Amazon
* * * Currently refurbished Iphone 7's go for 200$ on Amazon, 280$ on AT&T prepaid plan via Best Buy
* * * Apple screen repair cost out of warranty is 150$

Family:

4th Gen Ipad (somewhat-failed screen replacement)
* * * This didnt catch fire or anything. But unfortunately, i suspect I did not clean the residue/adhesive off the frame enough before attempting to place the new screen digitizer on. If it was not residue causing this failure, I suspect the plastic frame for the digitizer bought off amazon was a milimeter or two smaller than the screen, and this contributed to preventing the screen from setting in perfectly. Because of the Ipad case we had, the Ipad is still very much usable, but removing the Ipad out of the case is no longer advised. After factory reseting the Ipad, [Apple sign in was down for at least 24 hours](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/26/22200371/apple-icloud-sign-activation-down-support-iphone-home-pod), and many of the applications my family were using on this were no longer available for use due to Ipad 4's OS being too outdated for a few of our favorite apps, made this replacement especially more frustrating.
* * * Screen/Digitizer costs $15 on Amazon
* * * Apple fee would be $300 to repair out of warranty
* * * Newer models go for less than $300 on Amazon refurbished

2011 Imac (SSD Harddrive + extra ram installation):
* * * $280 for SSD hardrive and 32 gigs of ram expansion rather than purchasing a new $1000 Imac or a $600 refurbished Imac

Iphone X (screen replacement)
* * * Screen costs 150 due to lack of availability on the second hand market
* * * Apple repair costs $300
* * * Iphone X certified refurbished currently goes for $375

## Expensive phone horror stories

In high school, i bought an expensive Android for about 700$ (with my parents money of course). On the drive home from AT&T, the phone slid off the carseat, hit the side door panel, and the screen was cracked. Despite our AT&T insurance policy, which didn't cover broken phone screens for some reason, we were left with a broken phone and a bill for $700. It's not surprising how many people share similar stories to me.

Since then, I've tried to not buy any phones over 200$. About five years ago i splurged, bought a phone for about $250, and promptly dropped the phone breaking the screen again within a few days of having the device. So I really do stick to my policy of staying under $200 for my new phone devices.

Most top tier phone users criticize my habit of buying, accidentally destroying, and discarding Androids. It does seem wasteful and expensive at first glance rather than just purchasing an expensive Iphone, purchasing Apple care, and any other insurance that is standard today (add those costs on top of that $1000). I still have spent less than $1000 on Androids over the last 5 years and most importantly I am happy with my phones. By the time i croak, i could probably buy a new car with the cash saved by avoiding Iphones in my lifetime.

[Google](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-us-phone-upgrade-strategy-analytics.html) tells me average American Iphone users on average wait three years to upgrade phones. Ignoring insurance policies, accessories, and high cost of repair prices, factoring in average 10% S&P 500 growth yr/yr, and 50 years of saving 800$ every three years on not upgrading to premier phone models, the average consumer if missing out on roughly $375,000 in savings.

Because my cheap Android's aren't worth $1000, i feel comfortable opening them up in attempts to fix them. If i break my $40 dollar Android while trying to repair it, its not the end of the world. If I had some expensive piece of equipment, like a million dollar MRI machine or something, it really wouldn't make sense for me to open it up and poke at things with a screw driver.

## Fear of repair/Right to repair

The more expensive the device, like i mentioned in my MRI machine example, the less sense it makes to open something up to try fix it. The more expensive the device, the more manufacturers will resist allowing their parts to be available on the second hand market. This drives cost of repair up, and of course, encourages theft of devices so thieves can strip them for parts. If you are only buying premier products, you will never be able to fix them, and probably will never learn how either.

## Theft

With an expensive phone in your pocket, there comes some negatives as well. People steal expensive phones. People don't steal cheap phones. In the last few years, I've seen a few people morally crushed in public park basketball courts when they realize that their prized $1000 device was stolen their bags or cars while they weren't looking.

## Changing the things you do because you have a $1000 phone in your pocket

Is it raining out? With a cheap Android in my pocket, i don't really care if it gets water damage and breaks. With an expensive Iphone or top tier Android, you really need a waterproof case (throw on some dollars on top of that $1000 and reduce that sleek design you just paid $1000 for). You also should probably have a device specific charging doc, and device specific accessories because you don't want to repeatedly drop your expensive device if that can be avoided. Really what I am getting at here is, if you have a $1000 device in your pocket, you really can't just roam around freely without worrying about your phone. I frequently run with my dog, play basketball, jog, and ride a bike from A to B with my phone in my pocket. These activities can't really be done with a $1000 phone in your pocket. We've all seen people have public freak-outs after realizing they had accidentally cracked their Iphone after dropping with and without a case.

## Technical Specs

I understand that top tier phones are faster than cheaper droids. I get that the cameras are better. I get that you can use more sophisticated apps, games, and do things that cheap droids cant do. But are these technical limitations on cheap Androids worth 900$ for the upgrade? I don't think so.

While Apple pledges 5 years of support per device, Google recently cut support to one of their premier devices at 3 years, and it seems to me going forward you can't really trust manufacturers to manage your device's ecosystem regardless of how much you paid for it.

The technologies behind modern phones are amazing. Part of what makes that technology, and the utility of that technology, so amazing is the prices of these devices.

I think a lot consumers who buy top tier phones do so because they want to keep up with the Joneses and they don't realize they cant afford those devices. I don't think most people care if they can't play Call of Duty on their cell phones or their photos aren't going to get into National Geographic because the pixel quality lacks. In an era when American consumers are overworked, or underworked, and retirement plans seem to exist in peril for most Americans, its bizzare to see the average American pull out a $1000 device to complain about cost of living difficulties.
