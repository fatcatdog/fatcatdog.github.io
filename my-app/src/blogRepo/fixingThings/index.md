# Fixing Things

Over the last year, i've gotten into repairing electronics for myself, friends, coworkers, and family rather than just throwing these devices away or waiting for a few years for the next contract to expire. For most devices that aren't the newest model, or the premier brand, to pay someone to fix the device, costs more than the actual value of the device. Most manufacturers, simply don't allow customers to buy spare parts to fix devices on their own. I think this encourages people to just get on Amazon, Walmart, or their telecom provider, and buy a new device. If these companies really cared about environmentalism, which they all say they do, they would simply allow users to buy parts from them so they can fix them themselves.

In 2020 I've repaired:

For me

-2020 Moto E (screen replacement)
-LG Phoneix 4 (Screen replacement)

For coworkers/friends

-Two Iphone screen replacements (forget the models but they were older models)

Family

-4th Gen Ipad (screen replacement)
-2011 Imac (SSD Harddrive + extra ram installation)

In high school, i bought an expensive Android for about 700$ (with my parents money of course). On the drive home from AT&T, the phone slid off the carseat, hit the side door panel, and the screen was cracked. Despite our AT&T insurance policy, which didn't cover broken phone screens for some reason, we were left with a broken phone and a bill for $700. Since then, I've tried to not buy any phones over 200$. About five years ago i splurged, bought a phone for about $250, and promptly dropped the phone breaking the screen again within a few days of having the device. So I really do stick to my policy of staying under $200 as many devices are just too delicate to invest any more money into them while particapting in the actives.

Most Iphone users criticize my habit of buying, accidentally destroying, and discarding Androids. It does seem wasteful and expensive at first glance rather than just purchasing an expensive Iphone, purchasing Apple care, and any other insurance that is standard today (add those costs on top of that $1000). I still have spent less than $1000 on Androids over the last 5 years and most importantly I am happy with my phones. By the time i croak, i could probably buy a new car with the cash saved by avoiding Iphones in my lifetime.

Because my cheap Android's arent worth $1000, i feel comfortable opening them up in attempts to fix them. If i break my $40 dollar Android while trying to repair it, its not the end of the world. If I had some expensive piece of equipment, like a million dollar MRI machine or something, it really wouldn't make sense for me to open it up and poke at things.

Fear of repair/Right to repair

The more expensive the device, like i mentioned in my MRI machine example, the less sense it makes to open something up to try fix it. The more expensive the device, the more manufacturers will resist allowing their parts to be available on the second hand market. This drives cost of repair up, and of course, encourages theft of devices so thieves can strip them for parts. If you are only buying premier products, you will never be able to fix them, and probably will never learn how either.

Theft

With an expensive phone in your pocket, there comes some negatives as well. People steal expensive phones. People don't steal cheap phones. In the last few years, ive seen a few people morally crushed in public park basketball courts when they realize that their prized $1000 device was stolen their bags or cars while they werent looking.

Changing the things you do because you have a $1000 phone in your pocket

Is it raining out? With a cheap Android in my pocket, i don't really care if it gets water damage and breaks. With an expensive Iphone or top tier Android, you really need a waterproof case (throw on some dollars on top of that $1000 and reduce that sleak design you just paid $1000 for). You also should probably have a device specific charging doc, and device specific accessories because you don't want to repeatedly drop your expensive device if that can be avoided. Really what I am getting at here is, if you have a $1000 devie in your pocket, you really can't just roam around freely without worrying about your phone. I frequently run with my dog, play basketball, jog, and ride a bike from A to B with my phone in my pocket. These activities can't really be done with a $1000 phone in your pocket. We've all seen people have public freakouts after realizing they had accidently cracked their Iphone after dropping with and without a case.

Technical Specs

I understand that top tier phones are faster than cheaper droids. I get that the cameras are better. I get that you can use more sophisticated apps, games, and do things that cheap droids cant do. But are these technical limitations on cheap Androids worth 900$ for the upgrade? I don't think so.

While Apple pledges 5 years of support per device, Google recently cut support to one of their premier devices at 3 years, and it seems to me going forward you can't really trust manufacturers to manage your device's ecosystem regardless of how much you paid for it.

Final Note on My Rant

I really think a lot of people buy the top tier phones because they want to keep up with the Joneses adn they don't realize they cant afford that device. I don't care if I can't play Call of Duty on my cell phone or my photos aren't going to get into National Geographic because the quality lacks.
