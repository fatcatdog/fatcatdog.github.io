Over the last year, i've gotten into repairing electronics for myself, friends, coworkers, and family rather than just throwing out these devices or paying premium dollar to fix these gizmos. For most devices that aren't the newest model or the premier brand, to pay someone to fix the device costs more than the actual value of the device bought brand new. Most manufacturers, simply don't allow customers to buy spare parts to fix devices on their own which boosts non-professional repair cost and reduces quality on the second hand market (as well as encouraging the stealing of devices to be stripped for parts). 

I assume low-cost-tier phone/gizmo models are so cheap because manufacturers are able to recoup losses on increased cost insurance programs, cost of repair, and producers get a fresh chance to win over new customers with each new device recieved in warranty after the old model is decommisioned. Unfortunately, I think this encourages people to just get on Amazon, Walmart, or their telecom provider, and buy a new device every time a device gets chipped or cracked due to high cost of repair. If these companies really cared about environmentalism, which they all say they do, and if consumers really cared as they claim they do, i think some coordination between manufacturers/telecom providers needs to occur to improve the current status quo of buying, throwing out, and buying more disposable devices.

In 2020 I've repaired:

For me:

2020 Moto E (failed screen replacement)
* * * While most of these devices are extremely cheap based on purchase price, they simply aren't designed to be repaired easily. To replace the screen of this device requires a complete device teardown (removing 20 screws, unconnecting numerous cables before removing battery, which is not designed to be removed (which is glued to frame)). Unfortunately, I rushed while attempting to remove the battery and didn't loosen the adhesive attaching battery to screen-side of frame with a hair dryer enough, causing the battery to crack and catch fire during removal.
* * * The value of this device purchased brand new is about 120$ on Amazon/Motorola
* * * Screen costs $30-$60 on the second hand market (Motorola doesn't sell parts directly)
* * * Cost of certified repair (Motorola partners with shops to deliver parts) would be 150$ or mailing direct to to Motorola would be 130$

LG Phoneix 4 (Screen replacement)
* * * Brand new phone costs 40-60$ depending on time of year and vendor
* * * Screen replacement kit goes for $30 dollars here, so not much in savings in trying to fix, but still a fun experience.

For coworkers/friends:

Two Iphone 7 screen replacements
* * * Due to these phones being on company device plans, coworkers would be held liable if they were to turn their devices in to their company and would be forced to pay for the repair
* * * Each screen kit costed 24$ on Amazon
* * * Currently refurbished Iphone 7's go for 200$ on Amazon, 280$ on AT&T prepaid plan via Best Buy
* * * Apple screen repair cost out of warranty is 150$

Family:

4th Gen Ipad (somewhat-failed screen replacement)
* * * This didn't catch fire or anything. But unfortunately, I believe I did not clean the residue/adhesive off the frame enough before attempting to place the new screen digitizer on. If it was not residue causing this failure, I suspect the plastic frame for the digitizer bought off amazon was a milimeter or two smaller than the screen, and this contributed to preventing the screen from setting in perfectly. Because of the Ipad case we had, the Ipad is still very much usable, but removing the Ipad out of the case is no longer advised by me. After factory reseting the Ipad, [Apple sign in was down for at least 24 hours](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/26/22200371/apple-icloud-sign-activation-down-support-iphone-home-pod), and many of the applications my family were using on this were no longer available for use due to Ipad 4's OS being too outdated for a few of our favorite apps, made this replacement especially more frustrating.
* * * Screen/Digitizer costs $15 on Amazon
* * * Apple fee would be $300 to repair out of warranty
* * * Newer models go for less than $300 on Amazon refurbished

Iphone X (screen replacement)
* * * Screen costs 150 due to lack of availability on the second hand market
* * * Apple repair costs $300
* * * Iphone X certified refurbished currently goes for $375

2011 Imac (Not really a repair - but saved the device! SSD Harddrive + extra ram installation):
* * * $280 for SSD hardrive and 32 gigs of ram expansion rather than purchasing a new model $1000 Imac or a $600 refurbished old Imac

## Expensive phone horror stories

In high school, i bought an expensive Android for about 700$ (with my parents money). On the drive home from AT&T, the phone slid off the carseat, hit the side door panel, and the screen was cracked. Despite our AT&T insurance policy, which didn't cover broken phone screens for some reason, we were left with a broken phone and a bill for $700. It's always surprising how many people share similar stories like this to me.

Since then, I've tried to not buy any phones over 200$. About five years ago i splurged, bought a phone for about $250, and promptly dropped the phone breaking the screen again within a few days of having the device. So I really do stick to my policy of staying under $200 for my new phone devices now.

Most top tier phone users criticize my habit of buying, accidentally destroying, and discarding Androids. It does seem wasteful and expensive at first glance rather than just purchasing an expensive Iphone, purchasing Apple care, or any other suggested insurance program that is standard today (add those costs on top of that $1000). I still have spent less than $1000 on Androids over the last 5 years and I am still happy with my phones.

[Google](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-us-phone-upgrade-strategy-analytics.html) tells me average American Iphone users on average wait three years to upgrade phones. Ignoring insurance policies, accessories, and high cost of repair prices for Iphones and cheap-phones, factoring in average 10% S&P 500 growth yr/yr, and 50 years of saving 800$ every three years on not upgrading to premier phone models, the average consumer is missing out on roughly $375,000 in savings.

That means a normal American is missing out on a free cheap house by the time they retire and instead is just giving cash to Apple.

## Right to repair

I would assume the more expensive the device, the more manufacturers will resist allowing their parts to be available on the second hand market. This drives cost of repair up, and of course, encourages theft of devices so thieves can strip stolen devices for parts. If you are only buying premier products, you will never be able to fix them, and probably will never learn how either. I am aware that for some Apple products, replacement parts aren't available at all. After buying a thousand dollar computer, consumers unfortunately learn they need to spend $500 dollars in parts to replace a previous model's $5 computer-chip or broken widget.

## Theft

People steal expensive phones. People don't steal cheap phones. In the last few years, I've seen a numerous people crushed in public park basketball courts when they realize that their prized $1000 device was stolen from their bags while they weren't looking.

## Changing the things you do because you have a $1000 phone in your pocket

Is it raining out? With a cheap Android in your pocket, you don't really care if it gets water damaged and breaks. With an expensive Iphone or top tier Android, you really need a waterproof case (throw on some dollars on top of that $1000 and reduce that sleek design you just paid $1000 for).  Really what I am getting at here is, if you have a $1000 device in your pocket, you really can't just roam around freely without worrying about your phone. I frequently run with my dog, play basketball, jog, and ride a bike from A to B with my phone in my pocket. These activities can't really be done with a $1000 phone in your pocket in my income bracket. We've all seen people have public freak-outs after realizing they had accidentally cracked their Iphone after dropping with or without a case.

## Technical Specs

I understand that top tier phones are nicer than cheaper droids, the cameras are better, and you can use more popular apps, games, and do things that cheap droids cant do. But are these feature limitations on cheap Androids worth 900$ for the upgrade? I don't think so.

While Apple pledges 5 years of support per device, Google recently cut support to one of their premier devices at 3 years, and it seems to me going forward you can't really trust any manufacturer to manage your device's ecosystem regardless of how much you paid for it.

## Final Notes

The technologies behind modern phones are amazing. Part of what makes that technology, and the utility of that technology, so amazing is the prices of these devices.

I think a lot consumers who buy top tier phones do so because they want to keep up with the Joneses and they don't realize they cant afford those devices. In the covid-era when American consumers are overworked, or underworked, and retirement plans seem to exist in peril for most Americans, its bizarre to see the average American pull out a $1000 device to complain about cost of living difficulties and ineffective government.
